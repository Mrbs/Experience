# Experience
  All codes in this directory for heating service leakage and user behaviour identification
porject.In order to collect and create real world data, we employ Siemens Plc 200 and heat meter for main test application,
so fristly,we build all main test applications communication by RS485, Mbus hardware communication protocol, beside software 
communication such as 188,Modbus.
  Until now, we have finish main test applications communication.Next we will build web application to show these data,and create 
interaction layer to connect the user and control system.
  In the end, we hope that we can identify a dynamic balance between the heating circle system and users' behaviour based on hadoop 
cluster computing platform.
  Let's wait and see!
